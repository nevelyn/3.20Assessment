The Library

You've been contracted to write a piece of software for the local library. The software needs to meet the following requirements:

- The software should track the library's inventory of books
- Each book listing should include the title, author, genre (Fiction, Non-Fiction, etc.), length, and checked-in/checked-out status
- Librarians should be able to:
a.) add books to the inventory
b.) remove books from the inventory 
c.) view a list of all the books in the library
d.) view a list of all the books in a given genre
e.) search for a book by title or author

BONUS: This is a library, so books can be checked in and checked out. Librarians should also be able to:

1.) Change the checked-in/checked-out status of a copy of a book
2.) Track the name of the person who has checked out a given book and the date when it is due
3.) Mark a book as overdue
4.) View a list of checked-in books only*/
